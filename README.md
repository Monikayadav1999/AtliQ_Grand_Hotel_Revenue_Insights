# Provide Insights to the Revenue Team in the Hospitality Domain.

AtliQ Grands (imaginary Hotel Chain) owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. 

To regain their market share and revenue generation AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate Data Intelligence for future decision makings. To make that happen they wanted the Level 1 analysis from the historical data of their hotel chain to make data driven decisions and resolve the core problem causing areas.
